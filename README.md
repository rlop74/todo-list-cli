# ToDo list on CLI

## How to use:
- You will be prompted to choose from "add", "show", "edit" or "exit"
    - "add" - If you want to add a todo
    - "show" - If you want to to output all todos
    - "edit" - If you want to edit a todo
        - You will then be asked what number of todo you want to edit
    - "exit" - If you want to get out of the prompt

The logic works but this is a work in progress so it doesn't stored the todos anywhere after you exit the program yet.
